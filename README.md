### Basic workflow for Tassel 5 for GWAS analysis

See https://bitbucket.org/tasseladmin/tassel-5-source/wiki/Tassel5GBSv2Pipeline 

The scripts are numbered in the order that they need to be run with detailed
notes in each script for run params.

A stats file is generated and it is important to check the fltering paramaters
to make sure high quality snps are being generated.

Also note you should check the chromosome names in the reference fasta file and
see the mention of this in the scripts (xxxx).
